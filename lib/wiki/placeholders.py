    Placeholders strip pattern matches out of documents (dictionaries of {slug:
    content}) and replace them with unique tokens, delimited by invisible ascii
    characters, which pass unmodified through wiki processing. When wiki
    processing is completed, the stored matches are formatted as HTML by a
    given decorator function and substituted back into the text, which by then
    is HTML. This is used in most of the wiki's special-purpose processing:

    * Demo blocks
    * Backslashed characters
    * No-Format blocks
    * MathJax blocks
    * Footnotes/Links
    * Indexes/Tags
    * Bibliographies

        different placeholder types. If the delimiter were '|', and the marker
        were 'm', then the nth match in the source would be become '|m:n|'.
        In practice, an invisible, never-used chacacter is used as the
        delimiter, and any found in the source text should be preemptively
        stripped out by strip_delimiter_characters().
