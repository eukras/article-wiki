Special Characters and Icons

Any of the hundreds of freely usable ^[Font Awesome] icons can be included by prefixing the `:` symbol to an icon's name, e.g. `\:twitter` for :twitter, or `\:facebook-square` for :facebook-square. Some single-character shortcuts are also provided:

: i : Note that you also have icon blocks, like this; see @[character-blocks] for more.

Use ^[HTML Entities] to enter special characters; e.g. write 'd&eacute;tente' as `d\&eacute;tente`. If frequently relying on these characters, it is best to use a keyboard layout for your computer or device that lets you type them directly. See @[typography] for some typographic characters that are handled automatically.
