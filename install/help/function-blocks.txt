Function Blocks

Whenever you encounter some special formatting requirements -- anything past the point where wiki formatting remains a convenience -- then you should expect to find a special /function block/ that lets you enter data in a form that really /is/ convenient, and /just knows/ what to do with it.

Functions, like /y = f(x)/, will be familiar from maths, spreadsheets, or programming; function blocks look like that.


+ Examples of Functions

In $[wiki] the `BOX` function just puts a box around a section of text. The `COMPACT` function lets you write a digression, or supply a transcript that is not necessarily going to be read, so should occupy minimal space. Because small text reads better in columns, it takes the options `2cols` or `3cols`.

`COMPACT` is one of a set of core functions implemented within the wiki; these handle alignment, table formatting, and whitespace, among a few other common tasks. If you're curious about how wiki markup is being placed side-by-side with its formatted output in these examples, that's done with a function too, called `DEMO`, wrapped around whatever text is to be displayed.

Also, if you have some skill in programming, you can fairly easily write your own functions.


+ Wrapping Function Blocks

You can use functions inside other functions so long as you use different delimiters for each layer. Try:

| `---` | `===` | `>>>` | `+++` | `:::` | `%%%` | `\/\/\/`
