Article Wiki is an open-source writing tool for the humanities. It is
designed for long, structured arguments in reasonably plain text.
However, it gives you bibliographies and citations, footnotes and links,
and lets you construct indexes, all without making the plain text
unreadable. You can do your writing anywhere you can edit plain text.
You can download the software, run it yourself, and add new features if
you have a little programming skill. It is opinionated about layout, but
always readable online and in print. Try it out!
