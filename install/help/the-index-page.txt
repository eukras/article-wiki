The Index Page

The most important feature of Article Wiki is its structure, which is
like a directory of files rather than one very long file, or a set of
pages bound together into a book. These are joined and organised by the
table of contents in the `index.txt` file or page.

If there is no index page, the document parts will be arranged in
alphabetical order by their titles, and there will be no front matter
(headings, author, abstract, table of contents). Usually, you will want
to organise any substantial document into a structure.

A normal index page looks like this, only wider:

DEMO (index) ---
My Article

= An example of layout.

$ AUTHOR = Author 1 / <email 1>
         + Author 2 / <email 2>
$ DATE = 18 September 2017

+ Summary

> A short example document.

~ 

` Introduction
` The Main Argument
` ` Part One
` ` Part Two
` Conclusion
---

Notice the support for #[multiple authors: author, more than one] (as
many as you like), and the word counts appearing in place of page
numbers in the table of contents.

: i : To add a new section to a document, add it to the outline in `index.txt`, and navigate from there.

Because Article Wiki aims to take a document from brainstorming through
writing to publication, the index page of each document offers a nested
'outline' list, which is autolinked to new pages in the online editor.
The index page can thus be used as an outliner and brainstormer, in
which sections can be easily added, arranged, and deleted. Each section
corresponds to a file name:

! Outline ! File in Directory
| `My Article` | `index`
| `\` Introduction` | `introduction`
| `\` The Main Argument` | `the-main-argument`
| `\` \` Part One` | `part-one`
| `\` \` Part Two` | `part-two`
| `\` Conclusion` | `conclusion`

= Table $[t++]. = Titles and 'slugs', the names of document parts.

~ Slugs. ~ The names of the individual page files are turned into
# [slugs:slug]. This style will be familiar from blog or news URLs, even if the name is unfamiliar. They are made by taking the page titles, converting special characters to plain text, converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and consolidating spaces into a single dash.

This multi-file document format has strengths and weaknesses. Its main
disadvantage is that changing your headings means changing your file
names. However, the online editor helps with that, and other benefits
follow:

# It's easy to rearrange your document by rearranging your outline.
# In a wiki designed for long arguments, it is a convenience to be working only on one self-contained part of the argument at a time.
# Your document will be clearly organized when someone later -- maybe you -- has to maintain it.

~ Settings. ~ You will have seen some lines began with `$` in the index page: these are called values or settings. Some like `AUTHOR` and `DATE` are used by the wiki; these are capitalised. In this document, `\$[DATE]` is set to "$[DATE]", for example; see @[values-counters] below for a full summary. Those set in the index page are especially useful because they are shared with all the other pages.
