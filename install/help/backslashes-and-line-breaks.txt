Backslashes and Line Breaks

The wiki formatter will preserve any character that is /backslashed/, rather than allow it to affect the formatting. That's how the wiki markup in @[square-brackets] was entered.

DEMO ---
. \*[Bold Text] vs. *[Bold Text]
. \"quotes\" vs. "quotes"
---

Note that backslashing doesn't allow `<`, `>` or `&` characters to be inserted into the wiki's HTML output, however:

DEMO ---
. </br> vs. \</br\> 
. &lt;/br&gt; vs. \&lt;/br\&gt;
---

In some wiki formatting conventions a backslash at the end of a line indicates a line break. In $[wiki], however, we use the control characters for aligning paragraphs. See @[alignment] for more.

DEMO ---
. Line 1
. Line 2
