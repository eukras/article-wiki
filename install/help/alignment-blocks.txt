Alignment Blocks

Unlike regular paragraphs, aligns and floats have space above and below
them. Repeat the control character to start a new line without spacing.

DEMO ---
. Left aligned text
. with no indents
. on following lines.

; Centered text.

, Right aligned text.

~ A hanging indent, meaning that wrapped lines will be indented. 

: A block indent. Wrapped lines are also indented.

These basic formatting ideas can be used in a few more sophisticated
ways:

DEMO ---
~ Hanging Indent. ~ Giving a hanging indent a /leader/ will make it into a minor heading.

( ($[l++])
, Floating left marker.

) ($[l++])
. Floating right marker.

( ($[l++])
; Simple Equation'[2]

. Definition title
: ... with the definition here.
. Definition title
: ... with the definition here.

Note that Article Wiki doesn't presently support mathematical formulas;
the plan is to render inline SVG from `\\LaTeX()` code, but this is not
a high priority.

Finally, adding a /leader/ to a blocked indent will turn it into an
/icon block/, which can be useful for notes or documentation. (See
@[icons] for the names and shortcuts of the /Font Awesome/ icons.)

: i : This is an important notification, with a special icon to grab attention.
