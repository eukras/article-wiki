Collaboration

Plain text documents are very well suited to version control systems
that store the full history of a document's edits, and these in turn are very
well suited for collaborative writing. They were originally made for
collaborating on software. The best known version control system is /git/,
which was made to manage the source code of the Linux operating system for its
large and widely distributed team of programmers. However, any /Git
Repository/ can be used to store any file. 

There are several well-known providers of free Git repositories. ^[Github] or
^[BitBucket] are good choices. While BitBucket is more commercial than
community driven, it offers free /[private] repositories (as of late 2016). The
main requirement for using these is that a document's main editor must know how
to accept, reject, or merge changes that have been submitted by other users;
this is done in the Git repository, not in =[Article Wiki], but white room can be
directed to update from your repository and write back to it. Anyone needing a
collaborative writing tool, with a full version history, at little or no cost,
may wish to look into this.
