Why Use a Wiki?

~ It's Easy. ~ For simple layout, you can just pretend you're writing plain-text emails, and the wiki will understand what you want to see. For anything more, there's a `Help` button in the editor.

~ It's Powerful. ~ Some kind of text layout are easy to describe in plain text, but difficult to achieve in a word processor. @[interlinear-translations] are one useful example of this.

~ Work Anywhere. ~ But working in plain text also means that you can quite literally write articles by email (or on your phone), complete with footnotes, indexes and a bibliography, and they'll be ready to be copied straight into your document when you get back online.

~ Just Write, Don't Do Layout. ~ Wikis take responsibility for layout -- a bit like LaTeX, if you know that, but less complicated. They can be described as
` wygiwym` rather that `wysiwyg`. It's not that "what you see is what you get", like in a layout program, but that "what you get is what you /mean/." Some find this helps them focus on what they mean.

~ Write Once, Publish in Multiple Formats. ~ Wikis typically produce multiple output formats from a single plain-text master file. Article Wiki produces only HTML for online use, with a layout that works as well in print. Your browser can then print this as a PDF in whatever page format you prefer, including wide margins for proof-reading if you like.

~ Collaborate and Track Changes. ~ Working in plain text makes it easy to use version control systems for collaboration and cooperative writing. You can pull from any Git repository (there are free online services for public and private repositories), and later merge your changes and those of others back into it, while preserving its edit history.
