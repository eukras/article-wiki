Development

Developers can get themselves set up in the following manner; this is for
Ubuntu or Debian but should be easy to adapt as needed.

| Install:       | `git clone ht\tps://github.com.au/eukras/article-wiki`
|                | `cd article-wiki`
| Info:          | `vim README.md`
| Dependencies:  | `apt-get install python pip mysql`
|                | `pip install -r requirements.txt`
| Config:        | `vim config.yml alembic.ini`
| Database:      | `alembic up`
| Run:           | `python app.py`

You should see a message saying that the app is running on the hostname and
port number given in the config.yml file. By default, this means:

| Browse:     | http://localhost:8084/
| Help:       | http://localhost:8084/help
| Playground: | http://localhost:8084/write

The file structure of the application is:

| `alembic/`          | Database changes go here.
| `alembic.ini`       | Configure Database changes
| `app.py`            | This is the program!
| `config.yml`        | Configure database and server
| `fixtures/`         | Includes this help text...
| `models.py`         | Database structure goes here
| `requirements.txt`  | Python packages list
| `static/`           | Files and graphics
| `template/`         | HTML templates for the web interface
| `wiki/`             | Python code, including tests
| `wiki/plugins/`     | Add Python extensions here
