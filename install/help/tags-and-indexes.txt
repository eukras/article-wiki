Tags and Indexes

Here are some examples of #[tags], #[tags], and more #[tags]. The wiki
text for that last sentence reads `\#[tags]` three times. In Article
Wiki, tags are how you make #[indexes: index] that work both online and
in print.

Tag and index markers are visibly distinct from link and footnote
markers by being marked as letters rather than numbers. As with
footnotes, tag and index markers will follow any #[trailing punctuation:
punctuation, trailing] for the sake of smoothness.

Clicking on any tag's marker takes you to the index at the end of the
document, where you can find back-links to all the occurrences of that
tag in the document, making it easy to follow themes, esp. with `Tab`
and `Return` in a browser. A document being printed from a browser does
not have reliable page numbers, so the wiki will provide the section
number as context. This makes the tags easy to find even without page
numbering.

There are two important modifiers you can add to tags. Use an /alias/
when you want to tag a synonym, or to consistently tag singular forms as
plurals, or vice-versa; the alias will appear in the text instead.
Aliases are added at the front of a tag, separated by a colon:
`\#[alias:tag]`. Use a /sub-tag/ when you want to add a second level to
the indexing: `\#[tags, examples]`.

DEMO ---
* Case-sensitivity (`%`)
* * #[tags] #[Tags], %[tags], %[Tags]

* Aliases (`:`) and subtags (`,`)
* * #[tag:tags]
* * #[tags, use of]
* * #[tag:tags, use of]

Items can be tagged for the writer as much as the reader, for example to
mark work #[todo]. Also note the shortcut `%`, which is like `#` except
that it preserves capitalisation in the index.
