Alignment

Unlike regular paragraphs, aligns and floats have space above and below them. Repeat the control character to start a new line without spacing.

Note that Article Wiki doesn't presently support mathematical formulae; the plan is to render inline SVG from `\\LaTeX()` code, but this is not a high priority.

Blocked indents can be turned into icon blocks by adding icon names as leaders. See @[icons] for their names and shortcuts.
