Contributing Plugins

There are two ways to do this: The easy way that anyone can use...

* Just send your `wiki/plugins/$plugin.py` file to `$[EMAIL]`.

... and the hard way (that says you're a serious software professional). 

* Fork the ^[github repository], add your plugin to the code (with a
test, for extra points!), push it back to the repository as a single
commit, and file a pull request.

This is also the way to submit suggested #[bug fixes] and improvements to
=[Article Wiki] itself.
