Citations and Bibliography

While bibliographies can be formatted entirely manually, or with footnotes, there are often better way to work with references. In $[wiki], bibliographies can be added at the end of each section, or in a single `biblio.txt` file, or both.

When adding references in a section (rather than in `biblio.txt`), separate them from the body of your text with a dividing line containing only underscores (10 works well). Citations appear in round brackets by default, but these can be hidden with a leading minus character.

Your bibliography sections should contain /only/ bibliography lines. This
allows easy export from bibliographical software. In ^[Zotero], for instance,
use the export option "Create Bibliography from Items", selecting your
preferred citation style and "Output to clipboard". Then just paste it
into your bibliography block or file.

Note that when a citation simply reads `\@[ibid]`, it will be indexed to the
previous citation (though /op. cit./ does not track previous works, or /loc.cit./ previous references).

The main thing to remember with cross-references is that the first heading or
bibliography entry to match /all/ the words in the reference will be used.
Headings will be checked first. Any punctuation or markup will be ignored for
the purpose of cross-referencing. See @[cross-references] for more.
