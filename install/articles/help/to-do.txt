To Do


@ Next

_ Fully responsive menu with multiple layouts and drop menus.
_ Allow shorthand FUNCTION Blocks. HEADER/FOOTER as variations of COMPACT.


@ Bugs

_ Double-stops don't accommodate trailing punctuation. *Bold.* *Bold*. *Bold.* *Bold*. *Bold.* *Bold*. *Bold.* *Bold*. *Bold.* *Bold*.
_ Inline markup for links clashes with angled brackets: <http://example.org>. (Extra semi-colon appears.) In `\&gt;` the link is matched until the `;`.
_ :n Putting icons in the wrong place in lists :q. (Eliminate icons as unused. Add Unicode completion to editor.)
_ Wrong spacing in e.g. (pp. 16--17) . Handle brackets/numbers separately, or require backslashes always?


@ New Features

_ Ability to cycle checkboxes to ticked and sort them by priorities.
_ `< < <` and `> > >` for COMPACT headers and footers.
_ Bibliographies should become the last numbered sections and be more easily editable (side link).
_ Machine-readable CC licenses.
_ Self-documentation functions. For use in /help especially.
_ Vue textarea: Ctrl-Up/Dn to move lines or selected lines; Ctrl-Up/Dn to move blocks or selected blocks. Regular shortcuts and autocompletions.
_ Login without returning to home page.
_ Plugins. BIBLE, MATH:jax, MUSIC:ly, SLIDES, QUIZ, etc


@ Big changes

_ Multiuser through Github logins; retain local admin.
_ Convert Bottle to FastAPI and run in Lambda; use Saas Redis Store.
_ Assemble articles into larger books as .epub/PDF; `+` in TOC to recurse; syntax to link between books.
_ Airium for faster/neater HTML generation.
_ Fully relative CSS, so that DEMO or QUOTE blocks will have their content stay in proportion. (Only for one layer deep.)
_ Figures should become the second last numbered section, and allow text-based image formats like SVG or DOT. (Implement figures as an attachement to a book / page / section?)
_ Behavioural testing.
_ Containerised for Docker, with a simple import-archive setup.
_ Show cross-references when editing documents._ Login without returning to home page.


@ Ideas

_ Git integration; committing major version changes and suggested changes; with version incrementing in any part of a document, and in the header. 1.2.3 = Major.Minor.Subminor versions.
_ Outline slides in documents (hidden, `-`); use section heading and counter as title? Possibly Abbreviated block type for slides/quizzes, etc?

_ Inherit settings from parent in hierarchy (ChainMap).
_ Insert standard or customised templates into documents (popover or dropdown)
_ Allow date (or date-updated) to auto-update.
_ QUIZ blocks (`?`, with answers collated and rotated 180 degrees?)
_ Template imsertion and completion in the editor. Tab-through and select patterns?
