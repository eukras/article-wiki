Subheads and Double-stops

Subheadings within a section do not appear in the navigation, so it's up to the author to format them however they wish. This can be done with @[alignment-blocks] and @[square-brackets].

DEMO ===
; =[Here's a Subheading]
; /[And here's a sub-subheading]

(Regular paragraph continues here, after a gap.)

There is a form of short-cut called a *[double-stop] that makes this easier to type. Several of the common format markers (`/*_=`) can be repeated to either format a whole block of text, or just to mark off some leading text to create a inline subheading.

DEMO ===
. // Italicised Subheading.
; ** Bold Subheading.
, == Small Caps Subheading.
; __ Underlined subheading.

. Italics. // Body text...
. Bold face. ** Body text...
. Small caps. == Body text...
. Underline. __ Body text...

However, while this allows a great deal of control, it means equal space above and below the subheading unless extra space is manually entered with a @[delimiter]. So headlines are best entered with the `@` control character, which formats it in a customary manner. Double-stops are used to select bold or italic.

A range of common layout requirements can be solved with double-stops, of which the following examples are representative.

DEMO ===
Subheading. // This is an inline subheading at the start of a normal auto-indenting paragraph.

> Abstract. ** A bold inline subheading in a quotation will create a sensibly formatted abstract or summary block. 

~ Definition. // Here's a useful way to format some glossaries, definition lists, and so on.

= Table 1. ** A caption line.
