Backslashing the period characters in initials, acronyms, and common abreviations is a little inconvenient. There are text processing systems like `LaTeX` that maintain a list of common abbreviations and format them appropriately, but this is complex and it still requires occassional work-arounds. Backslashing is a single, simple principle that gives consistent results in all cases.
