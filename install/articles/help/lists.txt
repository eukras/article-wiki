Lists

Lists have a very simple syntax, whose behaviour can be modified with settings, for example to set the numbering or continue from before.

# List (Ordered)

* List (Unordered)

$ NUMBERING = continue

# This continues the previous
top-level list number
# after an interruption.

$ NUMBERING = 9

# Whereas this starts a list
# from a new number.

See @[icons] for the kind of symbols you can use with check-boxes.

To-do lists default to showing checkboxes as the list markers. However, these can be changed by putting an icon at the start of any line.
