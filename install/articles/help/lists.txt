Lists

Lists have a very simple syntax, whose behaviour can be modified with settings, for example to set the numbering or continue from before.

# List (Ordered)

# List

* List (Unordered)
* * List
* * * List 

$ NUMBERING = continue

# This continues the previous
top-level list number
# after an interruption.

$ NUMBERING = 9

# Whereas this starts a list
# from a new number.
