Settings

You will have seen some lines began with `$` in the index page: these are called values or settings. Some like `AUTHOR` and `DATE` are used by the wiki; these are capitalised. In this document `\$[DATE]` is "$[DATE]", for example. You can also make and use your own -- see @[values-counters] below for a full summary. Those set in the index page are especially useful because they are shared with all the other sections.
