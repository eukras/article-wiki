Values and Counters

In @[index-page] we saw how document information could be supplied with /settings/. In @[character-blocks] we saw how they can be used to control wiki behaviour. The same syntax lets users store their own values in variables.

~ Values. ~ Any values created with a `$ setting = value` statements can be echoed back with a `$\[setting]` statement.

DEMO ---
$ word = Bird
$ date = 1 Jan 2017
$ website = https://article.wiki

+ $[word] is the word!

; $[website]
; $[date]
---

Values set in your `index.txt` can be used in all other sections. Values can be changed at any point throughout your document, although this only affects the remainder of that section.

DEMO ---
$ name = Smith

~ $[name]. ~ Hello. My
name is $[name].

$ name = Jones

~ $[name]. ~ I'm $[name].
Good to meet you.

~ Counters. ~ If a value, say `\$[f]`, is an integer, you can increase it by one and display the new value by writing `\$[f++]`. If unset, the first number will be one. Counters have been used throughout this document to count tables, images, figures, and so on.

DEMO ---
| $[x++] | $[y++] | $[z++]
| $[x++] | $[y++] | $[z++]
| $[x++] | $[y++] | $[z++]

= Table $[t++]. = A different counter in each column.
