Wiki Syntax

The =[Codex] syntax differs from other wikis. This partly reflects its
multi-file format, comparable to the pages of a book, and partly its aim of 
creating LaTeX-like output from a wiki without ever resorting to convoluted 
source documents.

= Metaphors for =[Codex] wiki's document structure

I'll describe this as if each 'file' was a text file in a directory, even
though they might be actually stored in a database of some kind, or appear as a
printed document. 

~ A document is a directory. ~ A /document/ is a single large article like this
`/help` page. Its source is a directory of text files, rather than a single
text file.

~ Each section is a text file. ~ Each of the /sections/ of a document is a
separate file. The first line of each file is its heading, which will appear in
a table of contents.

~ The word 'page' is ambiguous. ~ A document is a single web page in a
browser, which produces many physical pages on a printer, but it is usually
most intuitive to call its section files its /pages/ in everyday discussion.

~ The index page ties them together. ~ The page called `index.txt` in each
directory supplies an outline that organizes the others. In a similar way,
document directories can be combined into larger works or libraries.
