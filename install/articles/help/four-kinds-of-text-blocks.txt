Four Kinds of Text Blocks

Wiki text is organized in four kind of /text blocks/. These are paragraphs, character blocks, function blocks and dividers. All text blocks are separated from each other by blank lines. Function blocks, however, may contain blank lines; their start and end points are indicated by three-character delimiters like `---`:

DEMO ===
This is a normal *paragraph*. 

> This is a quotation. It is an
example of a *character
block*, indicated by a control
character at the start of the
first line (in this case, `>`,
an angled right-bracket). 

VERBATIM ---
Here's some 
   verbatim text.
      It's an example
         of a *function block*.
            In this case,
               'VERBATIM' is the
                   function name.

(And that's a *divider*.)

These simple arrangements should cover almost all formatting needs, at least when augmented by /options/ and /settings/, which will be described below.
