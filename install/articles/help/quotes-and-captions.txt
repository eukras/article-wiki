Quotes and Captions

DEMO ---
> Simple quotes and citations work like email quotes. 
= Citation goes here
---

You will have seen that captions (`=`) are formatted differently
depending on what they follow. One following the title will be read by
the wiki as a summary. One following a table will be formatted as a
table caption; see @[formatting-tables].

A pull quote can be created by putting it inside a `FEATURE` block (and
usually a `FLOAT` block as well); see @[function-blocks] for more.

- Future development

* Allow captions with `~` and allow an inline &lsquo; `~` &rsquo; separator, both with the effect of `~\[citation]` markup; see @[citations].
