Why Use a Wiki?

" If this is already familiar, skip ahead to @[index-page].

~ It's Easy. // For simple layout, you can go a long way by pretending that you're writing plain-text emails. For the rest, there's a :? Help button in the editor, which brings you back to this page.

~ It's Powerful. // Some kinds of text layout are easy to describe in plain text, but difficult to achieve in a word processor. @[interlinear-translations] are one useful example of this.

~ Work Anywhere. // You can write articles by email, or on your phone, complete with footnotes, indexes and a bibliography, and they'll be ready to be copied straight into your document when you get back online.

~ Just Write, Don't Do Layout. // Wikis take responsibility for layout -- a bit like LaTeX, if you know that, but less complicated. They can be described as ` wygiwym` rather that `wysiwyg`. It's not that "what you see is what you get", like in a layout program, but that "what you get is what you /mean/." If you find the wiki gets your layout right, that's one less thing you have to think about when writing.

~ Write Once, Publish in Multiple Formats. // Wikis typically produce multiple output formats from a single plain-text master file. Article Wiki produces only HTML for online use, with a layout that works as well in print. Your browser can then print this as a PDF in whatever page format you prefer, including wide margins for proof-reading if you like.

~ Collaborate and Track Changes. // Working in plain text makes it easy to use version control systems for collaboration and cooperative writing. You can pull from any Git repository (there are free online services for public and private repositories), and later merge your changes and those of others back into it, while preserving its edit history.
