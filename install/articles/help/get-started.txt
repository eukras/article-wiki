Get Started

To try writing with the wiki just open the ^[playground] on any Article Wiki site. The following three points will cover most of your writing needs, though there are many more features available. See the @[cheat-sheet] below for a handy reference.

=[Firstly], you'll need to know how to lay out text. A single control character at the start of a line or a paragraph tells you how that block should be formatted, like how `>` indicates a quotation in email.

@ A Simple Example

Article Wiki is a wiki designed for humanities writing.

> Article Wiki is a triumph!
= Albert Einstein

Powerful and intuitive, without being awkward or intrusive. Check out the amazing:

* footnotes
* bibliographies
---

From this we can see that `@` is a subheading, `>` and `=` are quotes and captions, and `*` are bullet points. See @[four- kinds-of-text-blocks], for a full list of control characters.

=[Secondly], you'll want to add a little styling. This will get you started, but see @[inline-markup] for the full tour.

DEMO ---
# *Bold*
# /Italic/
# _Underline_
# `Monospace`
---

=[Thirdly], you might need to know how to add links and footnotes. The short answer is that you mark them in the text, then add their content as a subsequent paragraph, anywhere in the same section. In both cases the magic character is `^`.

DEMO ---
Here's a ^[link] and a ^[footnote].

Article continues...

^ https://example.org 
^ This is a footnote. 
---

This keeps your text free of interruptions, while also giving your links and footnotes as much space as they need. They'll be formatted in a way that is equally readable online (with links) and in print. See @[links- and-footnotes] below, and then the subsequent sections on indexes and bibliographies.
