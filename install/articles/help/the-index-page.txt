The Index Page

The most important feature of Article Wiki is its structure, which is like a directory of files rather than one very long file, or a set of pages bound together into a book. These are joined and organised by the /outline/ in the `index.txt` file or `index` page.

If there is no index page, the document parts will be arranged in alphabetical order by their titles, and there will be no front matter (headings, author, abstract, table of contents). Typically, an Article Wiki document will have an outline.

CENTER (80%) ---
. ** How do I...
. ... add a new section to a document?
: Add it to the outline, and navigate from there.
. ... reorganise a document's sections?
: Change their order in the outline.
. ... find sections not appearing in the outline?
: They appear in a notification box just below the Table of Contents.
. ... delete a section?
: Use the /Delete/ button in the editor window.

Because Article Wiki aims to take a document from brainstorming through writing to publication, the index page of each document offers a nested 'outline' list, which is autolinked to new pages in the online editor. The index page can thus be used as an outliner and brainstormer, in which sections can be easily added, arranged, and deleted. Each section corresponds to a file name:

! Outline ! File in Directory
| `My Article` | `index`
| `- Introduction` | `introduction`
| `- The Main Argument` | `the-main-argument`
| `- - Part One` | `part-one`
| `- - Part Two` | `part-two`
| `- Conclusion` | `conclusion`

= Table $[t++]. ** Titles and 'slugs', the names of document parts.

~ Slugs. // The names of the individual page files are turned into slugs. This style will be familiar from blog or news URLs, even if the name is unfamiliar. They are made by taking the page titles, converting special characters to plain text, converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and consolidating spaces into a single dash.

This multi-file document format has strengths and weaknesses. Its main disadvantage is that changing your headings means changing your file names. However, the online editor helps with that, and other benefits follow:

# It's easy to rearrange your document by rearranging your outline.
# In a wiki designed for long arguments, it is a convenience to be working only on one self-contained part of the argument at a time.
# Your document will be clearly organised when someone later -- maybe you -- has to maintain it.
