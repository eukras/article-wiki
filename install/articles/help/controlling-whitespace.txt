Controlling Whitespace

When you want to preserve text exactly, use VERBATIM. For the same effect, but with wiki formatting, use TEXT, with or without the 'verse' option.

DEMO ===
VERBATIM ---
1 2  3   *[4]    5
    Excuse me stewardess,
        I speak jive.
---

TEXT ---
1 2  3   *[4]    5
    Excuse me stewardess,
        I speak jive.
---

TEXT (verse) ---
1 2  3   *[4]    5
    Excuse me stewardess,
        I speak jive.
