Article Wiki is an open-source writing tool for the humanities. It is
designed for long, structured arguments in plain text. However, it gives
you bibliographies and citations, footnotes and links, and lets you
construct indexes, all without making the plain text unreadable. This
means you can do your writing anywhere you can edit plain text,
including in collaboration or version control systems -- or offline, and
just paste it in when back online. You can download the software, run it
yourself, and add new features if you have a little programming skill.
It is opinionated about layout, but always readable online and in print.

This page demonstrates most of Article Wiki's features, starting with
@[index-page], which provides a Table of Contents. Since page numbers
have no meaning in a web document, the Table of Contents shows word
counts instead, on the assumption that long articles are usually written
to word limits.
