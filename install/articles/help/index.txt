Article Wiki is an open-source writing tool for the humanities. It is designed for long, structured arguments in plain text. It provides bibliographies, citations, and footnotes without making the plain text unreadable. This lets you do your writing anywhere you can edit plain text, including offline, online, or in collaboration or version control systems. It's a web service, but the software is open source, so you can add new features yourself if you have a little programming skill. It is opinionated about layout, but always readable online and in print. Try it out!

This page demonstrates most of Article Wiki's features, starting with @[index-page], which provides a Table of Contents. Since page numbers have no meaning in a web document, the Table of Contents shows word counts instead, on the assumption that long articles are usually organised around word limits.
