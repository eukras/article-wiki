Inline Markup

Wiki markup is of two main kinds, #[inline markup: markup, inline] and
#[block markup:markup, block]. Inline formatting determines how text is
laid out within each text block, say, a paragraph, a list item or a
table cell. There are two kinds of inline formatting, general typography
and square brackets, and markup can always be prevented with
@[backslashes].
