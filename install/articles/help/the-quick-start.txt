The Quick Start!

To write a document, just head to https://article.wiki and open the ^[editor], where you can load up example documents and try any change you like. The following three points will cover most of your writing needs, though there are many more features available. See the @[cheat-sheet] for a handy reference.

=[Firstly], you'll need to know how to lay out text. #[Pretend you're writing email] and that a character at the start of a line or a paragraph tells you what it is:

^ https://article.wiki/editor

Without being awkward or intrusive.

* indexes,
* footnotes,
* bibliographies,
* and more

From this we can see that `+` and `-` are large and small headings, `>` and `=` are quotes and captions, and `*` are bullet points. See @[four-kinds-of-text-blocks], below, for a full summary of these 'block layout' options.

=[Secondly], you'll want to add a little styling. This will get you started, but see @[inline-markup] for the full tour.

# *Bold*
# /Italic/
# _Underline_
# `Monospace`

=[Thirdly], you might need to know how to add links and footnotes. The short answer is that you mark them in the text, then add their content as a subsequent paragraph, anywhere in the same section:

DEMO ---
Here's a ^[link] and a ^[footnote].

^ http://example.org 
^ This is a footnote. 
---

This keeps your text free of interruptions, while also giving your links and footnotes as much space as they need. They'll be formatted in a way that is equally readable online (with links) and in print. See @[links-and-footnotes] below, and then the subsequent sections on indexes and bibliographies.
