Text Alignment

" Note. ** Right alignment is not dependable for generating eBooks.

The `LEFT`, `CENTER` and `RIGHT` function blocks allow blocks of text to be aligned. To write a well formatted letter, for example:

DEMO +++
RIGHT ---
. Some Fine Locality
. In Yonder Province

. Dec. 1656
---

. Addressee
. Locality
. State

; *_[RE: IMPORTANT]

Dear sir, 

I would have written you a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.

~

RIGHT ---
. Yours etc.,
. 
. 
. ..........................

. Blaise Pascal

If you wanted to align the right-blocks perfectly, you could write `RIGHT (30%)` to give them both a fixed width. Also, to write a letter in the editor, remember to comment out the title line (use `%`) so it isn't visible.

Quotations can be formatted in the same way, with indents and a smaller font size, which is helpful for poetry:

DEMO +++
QUOTE ---
. Quote line 1
: Quote line 2 (indented)
, Quote Source
---
