Character Blocks

Character Blocks are paragraphs formatted by a single control character at the start of the first line: It must be the first character and it must be followed by a space.

CENTER (80%) ---
| `@` | Subheadings
| `> =` | Block quote; Caption/Citation
| `: ~` | Block indent; Hanging indent
| `\. ; ,` | Align: Left, Centre, Right
| `* # _` | Bullet list; Numbered list, To Do list (recurse with `# # #`)
| `\! |` | Simple Tables: Headers, Cells
| `\? %` | Note (visible), Comment (hidden))
| `/` | Translation (interlinear glosses)
| `-` | Chapter outlines (in `index.txt`)
| `& =` | Figures, Captions | TO DO

~ Recursion. // List characters (`* # + -`), can be repeated to indent them further ( see below).

~ Captions. // Captions (`=`) will format themselves for the kind of block that they follow, whether tables, quotes, pull-quotes or anything else.

~ Line wrapping. // Paragraphs and Character blocks are turned into a single line in the wiki, so the author needn't manage the line endings. It is assumed that any editing program will wrap lines automatically.
