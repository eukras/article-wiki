Character Blocks

Character Blocks are paragraphs formatted by a single control character at the start of the first line: It must be the first character and it must be followed by a space.

| `+ -` | Major and Minor Subheadings
| `> =` | Block quote; Caption/Citation
| `* # _` | Lists: Bullets, Numbers, Checkboxes/Icons
| `! |` | Simple Tables: Headers, Cells
| `. ; ,` | Align: Left, Centre, Right
| `: ~` | Indents: Block, Hanging
| `( )` | Float: Left, Right
| `' " %` | Aside and Note (visible), Comment (hidden)
| `/` | Translation (interlinear glosses)
| `?` | Quizzes (with '=' for answers)
| `\`` | Document outlines (in `index.txt`)

= Table $[t++]. = Summary of Control Characters.

~ Leaders. ~ Asides and Hanging Indent characters (`' ~`) can be repeated once to delimit an inline title (see below). This line is a hanging indent with a leader.

~ Recursion. ~ List characters (`* #`), can be repeated to indent them further ( see below).

~ Context. ~ Captions (`=`) format differently depending upon the kind of block that they follow, whether tables, quotes or anything similar.

~ Line wrapping. ~ Paragraphs and Character blocks are turned into a single line in the wiki, so the author needn't manage the line endings. It is assumed that any editing program will wrap lines automatically.
