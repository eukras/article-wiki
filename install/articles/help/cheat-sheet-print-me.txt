Cheat Sheet (Print Me!)

Click the `Edit` button to see how any effect was achieved in an article
or section. This opens that section in the `/playground`. That also lets
you print a single section, like this cheat sheet. Remember that a
leading backslash will neutralise any formatting character.


- Character blocks

Note that captions can be added to tables and headings as well as
quotes.

| `/` | Glosses (usually for Interlinear Translations)
| `' " %` | Aside, Note (visible), Comment (hidden)
| `\`` | Document outlines (in index.txt)


- Inline Square Brackets

Not these are combinable, and the the first five have shorthand, e.g.
`\*bold\*`.

| `\*[bold]`, `\*bold\*` | *[bold], *bold*
| `/ * _ \` |` | /[Italic], *[Bold], _[Underline], `[Monospace], |[Highlight]
| `; = { }` | ;[Sans Serif], =[Small Caps], Float left, Float right
| `+ - ' ,` | +[Inserted], -[Deleted], Superscript'[2], Subscript,[2]
| `\/\*[bold italic]` | /*[bold italic]
