The `%` character indicates a comment that is not displayed to the reader. However, while this text does not appear in HTML (or PDF or ePub, as a result), it is not fully hidden, because a reader can always look at the source in the online editor. A note can also be used in the title paragraph if you don't want the title to be visible, say if writing a letter.
