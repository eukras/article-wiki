Spacers and Dividers

Some patterns of one to three characters have special meaning when used as a paragraph; they create spaces and dividers. Tilde symbols create vertical space, up to four lines worth for four tildes.

Single space...

To here. Quadruple space...

~ ~ ~ ~

To here.

Otherwise, asterisks, periods, dashes, equals and at symbols can be used to make dividers. Lines made with three characters will be full-width. Best used sparingly!

A full-width divider in a `CENTER` block takes the width of that block, if finer width control is needed. Note the tildes for spacing.
